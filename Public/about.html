<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is William Stevens. I am 21 years old.
  </p>

  <p>I have been working in tech for 3 years and currently working as an Incident Handler at a company called Fortified IT.
    I have spent a few months struggling to understand where I would like to end up in the world of tech.
    Finally after some thinking and searching for courses that tickle my fancy I am set on my journey to become a developer.
    This will take a lot of determination and discipline but for me I see that at a challenge and a reason to keep pushing. 

  </p>

  <p>Determination and discpline is not something I am unfamiliar with and I would have to thank my mother for this. Why you might be wondering?
    Well it is because when I was 3 or 4 I got my first guitar from my mum and from that day the learning kept coming, I fell in love with the instrument from the first moment I picked it up.
    From that day- I never stopped playing music and even ended up obtaining my Diploma in classical guitar at the age of 16, a few months before lockdown.
    
  </p>
  During my time of learning classical guitar and perfecting songs for my exams I picked up 4 other instruments, below are the 5 instruments that I can play:
  <ul>
    <li>Acoustic Guitar</li>
    <li>Electric Guitar</li>
    <li>Paino</li>
    <li>Keyboard</li>
    <li>Drums</li>
  </ul>
  I never tended to do exams for the other 4 instruments I have learnt because I wanted to focus all of my energy on getting my diploma and that was the right decision.

  <p>Please follow me on my journey.
  </p>
