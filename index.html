<h2>Work experience:</h2>
    <h3>Incident Handler - Fortified IT ltd | Jan 2025 - Present</h3>
            <p>At Fortified IT I am an Incident Handler. I spend most of my time on service desk providing clients with support both remotely and on site. During my time at Fortified IT I have achieved my CompTIA A+, Ninja RMM certification and an in house on-prem and Azure assessment which I passed and got access to the systems. My job mainly consists of any issue from a Classic Outlook Read/Write sync errors to migration issues from on-prem to cloud. </p>

    <h3>IT Technician - Aspgate ltd | Mar 2023 - Dec 2024</h3>
            <p>At Aspgate I was an apprentice IT Technician. During my time at Aspgate ltd I was thrown into the deeper end on the IT spectrum. In this role I was mostly face to face with clients on site and managed their whole infrastructure from the building blocks of the network configuration to the setup of the domain controller and enrollment of endpoints. My proudest achievement while at Aspgate was single handeldy migrating an On-Prem domain controller to an upgraded server. During my employement I used most of my time to really boost my understanding of advanced systems not all Apprentices would lay their hands on.</p>

    <h3>Agricultural Engineer - CNH Industrial | August 2022 - Jan 2023</h3>
            <p>I started off my journey as an Agricultural Engineer working alongside a team to repair tractors that were sent to us and needed to be sent out to the buyer. We had to repair anything from a cracked coolant tube to comlpletely rewiring the electrics. This job really taught me how to work with a team and adapt to the situation around you. Time management was a key part of this job due to quota's and expectation. This experience really helped me build the foundations of who I wanted to be as a person in the workplace.</p>
